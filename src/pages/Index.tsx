        'Despite a clear nomination for 450 MT of VLSFO and 100 MT of LSMGO, the barge delivered only 420 MT of VLSFO and 92 MT of LSMGO. After our Chief Engineer requested the balance, the barge operator suddenly claimed "dangerous conditions" due to a mild afternoon breezeâ€”though the sea state was almost flat. Additionally, they handed us a questionable letter alleging the Chief Engineer agreed to stop pumping, which was not true. Our team has photographic evidence showing calm waters. We refused to sign the barge\'s letter, as the alleged "safety risk" appeared fabricated to avoid delivering the remaining fuel.',

        "We requested 400 MT of VLSFO and 120 MT of LSMGO, and the delivery was completed smoothly and on time. The barge provided 400 MT of VLSFO and 120 MT of LSMGO as requested. The crew was professional and efficient throughout the process, and communication was clear at all times. There were no issues with the pumping rate or safety, and the conditions on board were excellent. The Chief Engineer was satisfied with the operation, and all soundings and procedures were carried out as expected. We appreciate the reliable service and look forward to working with this barge again in the future.",
